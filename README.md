# TrendingYoutubeVideosAnalysis

This project aims to analyze trending YouTube videos to identify common characteristics and patterns. The project will use a public dataset of trending YouTube videos to answer questions such as:

--What types of videos are most likely to trend?
--What are the most popular video topics and categories?
--What video features are associated with high engagement?
--What are the trends over time in trending YouTube videos?

The project will use a variety of data science techniques, including machine learning and statistical analysis. The results of the project will be made available to the public through a GitHub repository and a blog post.

Potential applications of the project:

--The findings of the project could be used by YouTube creators to create videos that are more likely to trend.
--The findings of the project could be used by advertisers to target their ads to the most popular video topics and categories.
--The findings of the project could be used by researchers to better understand how people use YouTube and what types of videos they are most interested in.
